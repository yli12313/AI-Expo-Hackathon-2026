## What We Built

An AI-powered military admin assistant that takes a natural language request, navigates the Joint Travel Regulations and service branch regulations, calculates TDY costs to the penny, and generates compliant travel authorizations and leave forms — in seconds instead of hours.

Duty Line is not a chatbot that answers questions. It is a **task completion engine** — the output is always a filled artifact (cost breakdown, signed form, cited regulation) plus the reasoning chain that produced it.

### The Problem

A junior NCO planning a TDY trip today must:
1. Navigate the Joint Travel Regulations (1,000+ page PDF) for entitlement rules
2. Look up GSA per diem rates for the destination
3. Calculate lodging, meals, and mileage by hand using JTR rules
4. Fill DA Form 1610 or DD Form 1610 manually
5. Route it through the chain of command for signatures

**This takes 2–4 hours per trip and is error-prone.** Mistakes mean delayed reimbursement or out-of-pocket costs for soldiers. With 2.1M active duty and 800K reserve service members, the bureaucratic tail drains mission readiness across every branch.

### The Solution

A single conversation replaces the entire workflow:

> **"I need to send SPC Rivera to Fort Moore, Georgia for 5 days starting July 10. She's driving her POV from Fort Liberty."**
>
> Duty Line's ReAct agent calls three tools in sequence:
> 1. Looks up GSA per diem: Columbus, GA — $104 lodging / $64 M&IE
> 2. Calculates: $416 lodging + $288 meals (75% first/last day per JTR) + $518 mileage (370 mi x $0.70 x 2) = **$1,222 total**
> 3. Generates a filled DD Form 1610 PDF, ready for signature
>
> **60 seconds. Zero manual math. Zero PDF hunting.**

ReAct Agent (Thought -> Action -> Observation loop)
  |-- Tool 1: search_regulations  <- ChromaDB semantic search over 2,063 reg chunks
  |-- Tool 2: get_per_diem        <- GSA FY2026 rates, 649 locations cached offline
  |-- Tool 3: calculate_travel_cost <- JTR-compliant math (mileage, M&IE, lodging)
  '-- Tool 4: fill_form           <- PDF generation (reportlab + AcroForm fill)
```

### Why ReAct, Not Simple RAG

Simple RAG answers questions. Duty Line **completes tasks**. A soldier doesn't want to know what the JTR says — they want a filled DD 1610 with correct math. ReAct lets the agent chain tool calls (look up rates → calculate cost → generate form) to produce an actionable artifact, not just text.

### Model-Agnostic LLM Layer

The agent connects to any OpenAI-compatible API through a single environment variable. No code changes, no redeployment — just swap the endpoint:

| Provider | Config | Cost (per 1M tokens) |
|----------|--------|----------------------|
| **Claude API (default)** | `LLM_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1` | ~$3–15 input / $15–75 output |
| OpenRouter (Llama 3.1 70B) | `LLM_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` | ~$0.40 input / $0.40 output |
| Ollama (local) | `LLM_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1` | $0 — runs on device |

This means Duty Line isn't locked into a single vendor. If a better model comes out tomorrow, or if procurement requires a specific provider, or if policy changes which APIs are authorized on a given network — the switch is one line in a config file. The rest of the system (retrieval, cost calculation, form generation) is completely independent of which LLM is behind the endpoint.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- An LLM API key (Claude API recommended) OR [Ollama](https://ollama.com) for offline use

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone and set up Python environment
git clone https://github.com/yli12313/AI-Expo-Hackathon-2026.git
cd AI-Expo-Hackathon-2026
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure LLM provider
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add your Claude API key (or configure Ollama)

# 3. Build the vector store (first time only, ~5-10 min)
#    Parses all regulation PDFs, chunks semantically, embeds, stores in ChromaDB
python3 ingest.py

# 4. Start the backend (Terminal 1)
python3 -m uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000

# 5. Start the frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

### Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
```

## Demo Scenarios (5 minutes)

**1. TDY Travel Planning (2 min)**
```
"I need to send SPC Rivera to Fort Moore, Georgia for 5 days starting July 10.
She's driving her POV from Fort Liberty."
```
Agent calls: `get_per_diem` → `calculate_travel_cost` → `fill_form DD_1610`
Output: Cost breakdown ($1,222) + filled DD 1610 PDF download

**2. Regulation Lookup (1 min)**
```
"Is the GTC mandatory for TDY travel?"
```
Agent calls: `search_regulations [travel]`
Output: Cited answer from JTR 010204 with paragraph text

**3. Leave Request (1 min)**
```
"I need 10 days annual leave starting June 3 to visit family in Texas."
```
Agent calls: `search_regulations [leave]` → `fill_form DA_31`
Output: Eligibility check + filled DA 31 with 8 fields from soldier profile

**4. Cross-Domain Question (1 min)**
```
"My soldier is going TDY but also needs leave the week before — what paperwork?"
```
Agent calls: `search_regulations [travel]` → `search_regulations [leave]`
Output: Regulation citations from both JTR and AR 600-8-10, forms needed

## Why This Matters

- **3 million** service members navigate military bureaucracy daily
- **5–10 hours/week** spent by NCOs on administrative tasks that could be automated
- **Cross-branch coverage** — JTR is DoD-wide, plus Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps regulations
- **Verifiable** — judges can check the per diem rates, the JTR math, and the form fields. Every answer cites a specific regulation paragraph
- **Extensible** — adding a new regulation domain = ingesting one PDF + zero code changes

## Key JTR Constants (FY2026)

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| POV mileage rate | $0.70/mile |
| First/last day M&IE | 75% of daily rate |
| Lodging nights | travel days - 1 |
| Standard CONUS lodging fallback | $110/night |
| Standard CONUS M&IE fallback | $68/day |
